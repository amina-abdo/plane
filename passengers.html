        <p>Technology can help passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) find their way with ease around airports. One such deployment is a the new app from Neatebox – a runner-up in International Airport Review’s 2018 awards for the category of Accessibility – which allows passengers to specify and personalise what help and assistance they need while travelling through an airport. This has recently been deployed at Edinburgh Airport. Additionally, airports such as Heathrow and Wellington Airport are leading the charge with Aira’s new venture, which provides an assistance app for those who are blind or have limited vision. We can only expect to see these types of technologies increase to assist PRM around the airport setting. </p>
