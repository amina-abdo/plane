        <p>On the right side of the plane, the ramp team has swung into action. After opening the doors to the baggage and cargo holds, a belt-loader or a pod-loader is positioned, depending on the aircraft.
        "Rampie" is the industry term for airline employees who load and unload planes.
        The rampie inside the belly of a single-aisle plane places each piece of luggage onto the belt, and their partner takes it off the belt and puts it into a baggage cart.
        The carts head to the baggage room, and the luggage is dropped onto a conveyor, hopefully showing up on a carousel soon after you've arrived.
        Wide-body planes carrying hundreds of passengers needed an efficient way of handling luggage and cargo, so baggage and cargo pods were developed back when jumbo jets first appeared.
